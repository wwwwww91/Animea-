                    <p class="IP-desc">Zootopia is a beloved Disney animated film. It’s set in the eponymous city where mammals of all sizes and species—from tiny shrews to huge elephants—live harmoniously regardless of their natural predator-prey instincts.
The story follows Judy Hopps, a determined rabbit who becomes the first rabbit police officer. Teaming up with a witty fox named Nick Wilde, she sets out to solve a missing mammal case. Beyond the thrilling investigation, the film cleverly explores themes of prejudice and dreams, winning hearts of audiences of all ages worldwide.</p>
